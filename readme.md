Hi! I'm Melina, 25 yo and about 2 months ago I started learning the basics of web delopment (HTML, CSS, SCSS) in CoderHouse with no previous knowledge. And I've been loving the path so far, learning and studying again after a long time of not doing so.
Right now this project is for Yonkers a pizza place where I work as a chef.
